# Laundromat-Project
A project done in data structures class with three other teammates - Nick Dil, Ja'kari Bondardy, and Jessica. We were tasked with creating a project (in any code) that included at least three data structures. We decided to do a Laundromat where you schedule Employees, add product to Inventory, and show the businesses and profit gained.   
Data Structures - Java includes several subclass files and one superclass file.
